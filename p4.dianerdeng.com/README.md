Project 4 (FINAL)

For my final project, I chose to create a community for couponers. There are many coupon acquisition database applications out there but not many free apps that allow for calculation. Every site is usually in the form of a one master blogger sharing tips (i.e. the krazy coupon lady) but there are not any deal sharing sites with calculations of OOP (out of pocket cost). My application allows for a user to do a quick calculation as well as a shopping list view that does multiple calculations. The application also has a deal stream that allows for users to share deals and such. 

Improvements I have made on this since P2 and P3 is error handling, which did not make any sense to me in P2 but with javascript I was able to do so. I also created external javascript files instead of placing them in the head of pages where necessary. It took me a bit to figure out why the error handling did what it did (sometimes just minor syntax errors) but it does detect for unfilled fields as well as any errors with false fields (weak passwords for example). This site allows a couponer of any state/region to be able to calculate any deals based on their store's coupon policies which vary everywhere. The application allows for coupon calculations that include multiplying, if and where available. 

Features:
-Deal Stream
-Deal Sharing
